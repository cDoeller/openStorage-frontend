One popular way to create a masonry layout 
is by using CSS columns. You can specify 
the number of columns you want, and the browser 
will automatically balance the content between 
the columns, creating a seamless layout. 
Here's an example of how you can modify your 
CSS to achieve a masonry layout:

By setting column-count: 2; 
on your favorites-wrapper, you're 
telling the browser to create a layout 
with two columns. The items inside will 
automatically flow into these columns 
without any whitespace between them.

Adding break-inside: avoid; to your 
favorites-card-wrapper class prevents 
individual items from being split between 
columns, ensuring they display correctly.
